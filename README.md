##Providing API's to Explore Trending Topics, Discovering What People Are Talking About and More
===================================================================================================

### `OVERVIEW`

We are planning to use twitter data to retrieve the data from twitter using O'Auth authentication. And provide API's for users to explore the trending topics, discover what people are talking about etc. As part of this we are planning to do the following tasks.

	-API to find intersection between trends.
	-Collections of test results extracting text screen names and hashtags from tweets.
 	-API for creating frequency distribution of words in tweets.
 	-Collecting lexical diversity of tweets and API for it.
	-Generating histograms of words, screen names, and hashtags.
	-Generating a histogram of retweet counts and API for it.
	
### `DATA`

Using twitter data to retrieve the data from twitter using O'Auth authentication.

1. API for retrieving trends.
2. API to find intersection between trendsÂ 
3. Collections of test results.
4. Extracting text screen names and hashtags from tweets.
5. API for creating frequency distribution of words in tweets.
6. Collecting lexical diversity of tweets and API for it.
7. Generating histograms of words, screen names, and hashtags.
8. Generating a histogram of retweet counts AND API for it.

### `RESEARCH QUESTIONS`

To Explore Trending Topics, Discovering What People Are Talking About and More.
How social media impacts on people.

Tasks
1. Creating a script to access twitter data from OAuth and providing an API for it.
2. Retrieving data required for the above mentioned tasks.
3. Creating API's where ever required so that users can use it.

### `MODELS AND ANALYSIS`

We are planning our models and preliminary analysis will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook and development in python.
 
### `CODE AND APPLICATION`

Will post the code in our GitHub repository and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level.

### `PROJECT MANAGEMENT`

We are team of five, SaiRaj Nagula, Bharadwaj Mateti, Surya Kiran Yelagam, Arunkumar Bonthala, Kamal Nayan Raju Kanchanapalli.we will be sharing our work among ourselves. SaiRaj will be taking care of development, data analysis. Arunkumar and surya are taking back end work consisted of an API that was created to provide data to the front end. And Writing O Auth script to pull linked in Connections and Bharadwaj and kamal would work on data set, data analysis and UI development and together we are collaborating to check the progress of the project testing.

| 2/15/16 | Collected data and analysed it.| All Team Members.| Check Point 1 Completed.|
| 3/08/16 | creating a streaming script which collects data from twitter because twitter has a limit on number of requests people make per day.We are Writing a script to collect the trends in twitter data and aslo Writing a script to pull in all the tweets of each trend. | sairaj,surya,arun | developed an algorithm for performing analysis on tweets to see how many of them are psitive,negtive and neutral. |

### NOTE:
My self Bharadwaj Mateti and one of my group member Kamal Nayan Raju was working on collection of datasets and devolopment on user interface.
